            <p>The Cake Quake landed in Notting Hill in early 2004 to become the home of quality American baking in London. Today it has six branches in London and Surrey and is famed the world over for its delicious cupcakes and other freshly baked sweet treats and desserts.</p>
            <p>We make amazing cakes. And cupcakes. And brownies.
                You can order online now from our brand new menu, which includes all our favourite cakes and bakes of the moment, or visit our shop in Soho where we bake an entirely new menu of sweet treats every day of the week.
                In the meantime, read on to discover what makes our cakes so special.</p>
            <p>Our cakes are filled, layered, swirled, piped and drizzled. We love trying new recipes and techniques and there's little we won't do in search of cake perfection. That's why we make every addition to our cakes and cupcakes - meringues, curds, sauces, brittles, caramels and more - from scratch every day, and why every cake is baked and decorated fresh to order.</p>
